		<strong>Using your virtual account</strong>
	</div>
	<p>You may use your Virtual Account only after it is activated and virtually
		delivered. A Visa debit Virtual Account number and an expiration date
		will be established for you. This information will be encrypted and
		delivered to you virtually and securely via the Quilo App. No physical
		card will be delivered. Value will be loaded in the Virtual Account by
		your Program Sponsor. The balance available for authorizing transactions
		with your Virtual Account is the lesser of your available balance in
		your Virtual Account or any dollar limitation disclosed for the
		transaction being performed. Upon any purchase or other transaction, the
		amount available in the Virtual Account will be reduced by the amount of
		such withdrawal or purchase.</p>
	<p>You are responsible for all authorized transactions using your Virtual
		Account. You do not have the right to stop payment on any purchase
		transaction originated by use of your Virtual Account. </p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Limitations on Using Your Virtual Account.</strong>
	</div>
	<p>Your virtual account may only be used for purchases consistent with this
		agreement. You may use your virtual account wherever visa is accepted,
		however the virtual account cannot be used for: </p>
	<ul class="level-1">
		<li>Any purchase where a physical card must be handed to a merchant for
			payment; </li>
		<li>Any transaction that requires in person presentment of a physical
			debit or credit card;</li>
		<li>"Dual mode" transactions (e.g., theatre ticket purchases, hotel
			stays, car rentals, online purchases picked up in person, and other
			transactions where subsequent presentment of a physical debit or
			credit card bearing the same account number as the virtual account
			used to purchase the item over the internet is required in order to
			obtain the item). </li>
	</ul>
	<p>You may use your Virtual Account only in the manner and for the purposes
		authorized by this Agreement. You may not use your Virtual Account for
		any illegal purpose. You may not use your Virtual Account to initiate
		any type of electronic gambling transaction through the Internet. We may
		restrict access to your Virtual Account if we notice suspicious
		activities. If access is denied, you should contact us so that we can
		discuss and rectify any problems, or we may notify you via a Quilo App
		notification or via SMS. </p>
	<p>You may not use your Virtual Account to make a purchase in excess of the
		amount of prepaid funds available for use with your Virtual Account
		(minus any value that is subject to a hold due to authorization). If for
		any reason a purchase occurs that exceeds the value on the Virtual
		Account, you are responsible for repaying us in full. We may
		automatically deduct any amount you owe under this Agreement from any
		future transfer of value to the Virtual Account. If we are required to
		undertake legal proceedings against you because you fail to comply with
		the terms of this Agreement, you must pay our reasonable attorneys’ fees
		and other costs of the proceedings. Your responsibility for fees and
		costs shall in no event exceed the maximum amount allowed by law </p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Authorizations and Holds.</strong>
	</div>
	<p>Any entity honoring your Virtual Account will be required to obtain
		approval or authorization for any transaction in accordance with the
		rules of Visa U.S.A., Inc. When an authorization is issued, a thirty-day
		hold may be placed on the value on the Virtual Account in the amount of
		the authorization. When you use your Virtual Account in a tipping
		environment (at restaurants, bars, barber or beauty shops or for taxis
		or limos), the amount of authorization may include a tip of 20%-25%. Up
		to a ninety-day hold may be placed on the value on the Virtual Account
		in the amount of the preauthorization request made by hotels and rental
		merchants. If the authorization request varies from the amount of the
		transaction the merchant subsequently submits to the Visa system,
		settlement of the transaction may not remove the hold, which may remain
		on the Virtual Account until the hold days have expired. If your Virtual
		Account is subject to a hold, the value on the Virtual Account that is
		subject to the hold will not be available for other purposes. </p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Account Loading.</strong>

		ninety (90) days of inactivity, or if we are otherwise required by
		applicable law to refund to you any funds in your Virtual Account, we
		will refund the funds to you by transferring such funds to your account
		with the Program Sponsor. Your Virtual Account will remain open and
		available for future deposits. </p>
	<div class="section_title">Section 6 </div>

		in error, so that you will have the money during the time it takes us to
		complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or
		question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we
		may not credit your account.</p>
	<p>For errors involving new accounts or pointof-sale, we may take up to 90

	<div class="block">
		<strong>Arbitration.</strong>
	</div>
	<p class="imp">Please read this carefully.</p>
	<p>You agree that any dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration.
		Arbitration replaces the right to go to court, including the right to a
		jury and the right to participate in a class action or similar
		proceeding. In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by an arbitrator
		instead of a judge or jury. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more
		limited than court procedures. You also agree any arbitration will be
		limited to the dispute between you and us and will not be part of a
		class-wide or consolidated arbitration proceeding.</p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Agreement to Arbitrate..</strong>
	</div>
	<p>You and we agree that any dispute will be resolved by arbitration. This
		Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 USCS § 1
		et seq. and the substantive law of the state of Florida.</p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Definitions.</strong>
	</div>
	<p>Arbitration is a means of having an independent third party resolve a
		dispute. A “dispute” is any controversy or claim between you and us. The
		term dispute is to be given its broadest possible meaning and includes,
		without limitation, all claims or demands (whether past, present or
		future, including events that occurred prior to the opening of this
		account), based on any legal or equitable theory (tort, contract or
		otherwise), and regardless of the type of relief sought (i.e. money,
		injunctive relief or declaratory relief). A dispute includes, by way of
		example and without limitation, any claim based upon federal or state
		constitution, statute, ordinance, regulation, or common law, and any
		issue concerning the validity, enforceability or scope of this
		arbitration agreement. The term “you” includes any authorized user and
		also your heirs, guardian, personal representative or trustee in
		bankruptcy. The term “us” includes our employees, officers, directors,
		attorneys, affiliated companies, predecessors and assigns, as well as
		our marketing, servicing and collection representatives and agents.</p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Selection of Arbitrator.</strong>
	</div>
	<p>If a dispute arises, the party asserting the claim or defense must
		initiate arbitration, provided you or we may first try to resolve the
		matter informally or through customary business methods, including
		collection activity. The party filing arbitration may initiate and
		pursue the matter with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or
		JAMS, The Resolution Experts or we may agree upon a different arbitrator
		described below. If you claim you have a dispute with us, but do not
		initiate arbitration or select an arbitrator, we may do so. You may
		obtain copies of the current rules of arbitration and forms and
		instructions for initiating arbitration by contacting them as follows:
	</p>
	<ul class="level-1">
		<li> American Arbitration Association, 335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10, New
			York, NY 10017-4605<br> Website: <a
				href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>
		</li>
		<li> JAMS, The Resolution Experts, 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Irvine,
			CA 92614,<br> Website: <a
				href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a><br> or by
			phone at (949) 224-1810 or (800) 352-5267. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>The policies and procedures of the arbitrator will apply provided that
		they are consistent with this arbitration agreement. To the extent the
		arbitrator’s rules or procedures are different than the terms of this
		arbitration agreement, the terms of this arbitration agreement shall
		apply. If either of the arbitration firms are not available to
		adjudicate the matter, or if the neither is convenient or acceptable to
		you, you and we may agree on one or more neutral arbitrators. If you and
		we cannot agree on arbitrator(s), an arbitrator will be appointed by a
		court with jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to the FAA.</p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Cost of Arbitration.</strong>
	</div>
	<p>We will pay the filing fee and any costs or fees charged by the
		arbitrator regardless of whether you or we initiate the arbitration.
		Except where otherwise provided by applicable law, each party will be
		responsible for its own attorneys’ fees and other expenses. Unless
		prohibited by law, the arbitrator may award fees, costs and reasonable
		attorneys’ fees to the party who substantially prevails in the
		arbitration.</p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Place of Arbitration.</strong>
	</div>
	<p>Unless you and we agree to a different location, the arbitration will be
		held in the same city as the U.S. District Court closest to your
		then-current mailing address. The arbitrator may decide the matter based
		upon written submissions by the parties if permitted under the
		arbitration rules.</p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Waiver of Rights.</strong>
	</div>
	<p>You are waiving your right to a jury trial, to have a court decide your
		dispute, to participate in a class action lawsuit and to certain
		discovery and other procedures that are available in a lawsuit. The
		arbitrator has the ability to award all remedies available by statute,
		at law or in equity to the prevailing party. You and we agree that the
		arbitrator has no authority to conduct class-wide proceedings and will
		be restricted to resolving the individual disputes between you and us.
		If an arbitration firm or arbitrator fails or refuses to enforce the
		waiver of class-wide arbitration, then the dispute will proceed in
		court. The validity, effect and enforceability of this waiver of class
		action lawsuit and class-wide arbitration is to be determined solely by
		a court of competent jurisdiction and not by the arbitration firm or
		arbitrator. If such court refuses to enforce the class-wide arbitration
		waiver, then it is agreed the dispute will proceed in court rather than
		arbitration.</p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Review of Arbitration Award.</strong>
	</div>
	<p>The arbitrator shall apply applicable federal and Florida substantive law
		and the terms of your Agreement with us. The arbitrator shall make
		written findings and the arbitrator’s award may be filed with any court
		having jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall be supported by
		substantial evidence and must be consistent with your Agreement with us
		and applicable law or may be set aside by a court upon judicial review.
	</p>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Other Provisions.</strong>
	</div>
	<p>If any portion of this arbitration agreement is subsequently deemed
		unenforceable, the enforceability of any other provision of this
		arbitration agreement shall not be affected and the unenforceable term
		shall be amended such that it is enforceable to the maximum extent
		permitted by law provided that if a class action litigation or a
		class-wide arbitration is permitted for any reason, either party may
		require that the entire dispute be heard by a Judge, sitting without a
		jury, under applicable court rules and procedures. This arbitration
		provision shall survive: </p>
	<ul class="level-1">
		<li>Termination or changes in your Agreement with us, your Virtual
			Account, or the relationship between you and us concerning your
			Virtual Account;</li>
		<li>The bankruptcy of any party; </li>
		<li>Any transfer, sale or assignment of the Virtual Account, or any
			amounts owed on the Virtual Account, to any other person or entity
		</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Right to Opt-Out.</strong>
	</div>
	<p>If you do not wish to agree to arbitrate all disputes with us, you must
		advise us in writing through the Quilo App within thirty (30) days of
		you electronically agreeing to this Agreement.</p>
